# birthday-problem

In probability theory, the birthday problem asks for the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. The birthday paradox is that, counterintuitively, the probability of a shared birthday exceeds 50% in a group of only 23 people. (source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem))

With this script you can play a little bit with the number of people or the desired probability.
